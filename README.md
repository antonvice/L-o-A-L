# L-o-A-w-L (Level of Abstraction with LLM)

## Overview
L-o-A-w-L  (Level of Abstraction with LLM) is an innovative tool designed to dynamically adjust the level of abstraction in a document using language learning models (LLMs). By leveraging the power of LLMs, L-o-A-w-L allows users to interactively explore documents at various levels of detail, simply by scrolling to increase or decrease the abstraction level. This project aims to enhance reading efficiency and comprehension, making it easier to grasp complex documents or quickly get an overview of lengthy texts.

## Features
- **Dynamic Abstraction Adjustment**: Seamlessly increase or decrease the level of detail in a document with a simple scroll action.
- **LLM Integration**: Utilizes advanced language learning models to generate concise summaries or expand on details within the document.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive controls for adjusting the document's abstraction level, tailored for ease of use.
- **Customizable Settings**: Users can set preferences for default abstraction levels, summary length, and more.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

## How It Works
L-o-A-w-L takes a document as input and generates multiple abstraction layers using language learning models. These layers range from highly detailed to very abstract summaries. The user can then interact with the document through a web interface, where scrolling up or down adjusts the level of detail displayed, allowing for a customized reading experience.
